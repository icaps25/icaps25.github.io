# Accommodation

<!-- Please book your accommodation as soon as possible! Banff is a popular tourist destination and affordable accommodation will become harder to find the longer you leave it. -->

<!-- There are rooms available at the Banff Centre, but there are no available reservations that cover the entire duration of the conference.

For anyone looking for a room outside of the conference venue, there are many [hotels in Banff](https://www.google.com/travel/search?q=hotels%20in%20banff&g2lb=2503771%2C2503781%2C4284970%2C4291517%2C4814050%2C4874190%2C4893075%2C4899571%2C4899572%2C4965990%2C72277293%2C72302247%2C72317059%2C72406588%2C72414906%2C72421566%2C72458066%2C72462234%2C72470440%2C72470899%2C72471280%2C72472051%2C72473841%2C72481458%2C72485656%2C72485658%2C72486593%2C72494250%2C72513422%2C72513513%2C72520082%2C72523972%2C72534000%2C72536387%2C72538597%2C72549171%2C72561422%2C72562082&hl=en-CA&gl=ca&ssta=1&ts=CAESCgoCCAMKAggDEAAaeApaEi4yJTB4NTM3MGNhNDU5MTBjNGFmZDoweGNhYWZhZWJlZGFhYzk0NjM6BUJhbmZmGigKEgnjQN2j5JRJQBE805ko4eVcwBISCawzLpGlmElAETzTmbAg4lzAEhoSFAoHCOgPEAYYAhIHCOgPEAYYBxgFMgIIASoHCgU6A0NBRA&qs=CAE4BkgAWksIATJHqgFEEAEqCiIGaG90ZWxzKAAyHxABIhtlpaL1L4HDj3whs-QjzdPCXcKJMiE7_Z5XrUMyExACIg9ob3RlbHMgaW4gYmFuZmY&ap=KigKEgnjQN2j5JRJQBE805ko4eVcwBISCawzLpGlmElAETzTmbAg4lzAMAJoAQ&ictx=1&ved=0CAAQ5JsGahcKEwiYiNbkk7iFAxUAAAAAHQAAAAAQCQ) but most tend to be expensive. In such cases we recommend sharing a room -- you can coordinate to find a roomate on the [Planning Slack Channel](https://slack.planning.domains/), #icaps24-shared-housing. Check AirBnB and hostels for other accommodations.

The town of Canmore is a 20 minute drive from Banff and is a nice place to stay. It has accommodation, some of which will be at a more reasonable price (it is also not in Banff National Park, which means some of the taxes do not apply). There is a regular bus service between Canmore and Banff. -->

Melbourne Connect is located close to the Melbourne CBD, offering a wide range of accommodation options.

There are plenty of hotels within a 15-minute walk of Melbourne Connect, so you’ll have lots of options close to the venue through hotel search engines — here’s a **[handy one](https://tinyurl.com/ypbk5e9s)** to get you started.  In many cases, the prices there are even better than what we could get with conference promo codes. Just pop in your dates and click the Walk icon at the bottom to see how far each hotel is from the venue. You may want to check also booking engines such as [booking](https://www.booking.com/) or [agoda](https://www.agoda.com/).
