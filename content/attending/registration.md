## Information for Authors

Each paper accepted to the main conference program (AAAI proceedings) must be accompanied by registration and payment of either regular fee or student fee. It is up to the authors to decide who will be the presenter and will pay the registration fee. **One author registration fee may cover up to 2 of their papers**. You can buy an additional third paper for $264 AUD.

Physical attendance and in-person presentation is expected for each paper. No on-line presentations will be allowed.

When asked to introduce an ID for a paper in the registration form, use the openreview ID. There's no need to correct this information if you already registered and used the ID in the accepted papers from our website.
