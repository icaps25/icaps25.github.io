The [International Conference on Automated Planning and
Scheduling](https://www.icaps-conference.org) (ICAPS) is
the premier forum for exchanging news and research results on the theory and
applications of intelligent and automated planning and scheduling technology.

Planning and Scheduling are optimisation problems which require finding a set of actions to complete a task, to achieve a goal, or to optimise one or more objectives. Effective solutions to planning and scheduling problems are critical for a variety of important application areas, including Industry 4.0, aerospace systems, supply chain management, software engineering, robotics, education, digital entertainment and more.

**ICAPS 2025** is the 35th edition of the ICAPS conference series and will take place in the heart of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia in **November 9-14, 2025**. The conference will be co-located with the following events:

- [KR-2025](https://kr.org//KR2025/): The 22nd International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning.
- [CPAIOR-2025](https://sites.google.com/view/cpaior2025): The 22nd International Conference on the Integration of Constraint Programming, Artificial Intelligence, and Operations Research.
- [Planning and Optimisation Summer School 2025](https://opss25.pathfinding.ai/), unlock the potential of planning and optimisation with us on 3-7th November in Melbourne, Australia.

<!-- The organisers of ICAPS 2025 invite [technical paper
submissions](/calls/main_track) from
researchers and industrial practitioners, on all aspects of automated planning
and scheduling technology. Relevant contributions include, but are not limited
to:

- Theoretical and empirical studies of planning and scheduling problems and algorithms;
- Novel techniques and approaches that extend the scope and scale of problems that can be solved;
- Novel tools and frameworks for analysing and verifying the properties of systems executing plans, policies or schedules;
- Studies of applying automated planning and scheduling technologies to significant problems with deep technical insight. -->
