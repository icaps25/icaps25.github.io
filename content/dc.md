## Keynote Talks
**Title: Universal Algorithmic Intelligence**
Speaker: [Dr. Marcus Hutter](https://www.hutter1.net/)

Abstract: There is great interest in understanding and constructing generally intelligent systems approaching and ultimately exceeding human intelligence. Universal AI is such a mathematical theory of machine super-intelligence. More precisely, AIXI is an elegant parameter-free theory of an optimal reinforcement learning agent embedded in an arbitrary unknown environment that possesses essentially all aspects of rational intelligence. The theory reduces all conceptual AI problems to pure computational questions. After a brief discussion of its philosophical, mathematical, and computational ingredients, I will give a formal definition and measure of intelligence, which is maximized by AIXI. AIXI can be viewed as the most powerful Bayes-optimal sequential decision maker, for which I will present general optimality results. This also motivates some variations such as knowledge-seeking and optimistic agents, and feature reinforcement learning. Finally I present some recent approximations, implementations, and applications of this modern top-down approach to AI.

**Title: Learning Interpretable Models for Autonomous Assessment of Taskable AI Systems**
Speaker: [Dr. Pulkit Verma](https://pulkitverma.net/)

Abstract: Taskable AI systems are increasingly expected to operate in diverse, user-specific environments and perform tasks tailored to individual needs, all while improving over time. A critical challenge is determining whether these AI systems can safely and effectively fulfill the specific tasks users have in mind. In this talk, I will present my work on addressing this challenge, including methods for conducting independent, post-deployment differential assessments of AI systems. I will discuss the necessary requirements these systems must meet to enable such assessments. A key aspect of my approach involves a personalized AI assessment module that allows the AI to execute instruction sequences in simulators and respond to user queries about these executions. Finally, I will share our findings demonstrating that even a basic query-response interface can efficiently produce a user-interpretable model of an AI system's capabilities.
