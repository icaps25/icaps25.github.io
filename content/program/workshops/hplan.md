# Eighth ICAPS Workshop on Hierarchical Planning (HPlan 2025)

Topics of interests include but are not limited to:

- theoretical foundations, e.g., complexity results
- heuristics, search, and other solving techniques for plan generation
- techniques and foundations for providing modeling support
- challenges and lessons learned from modeling systems (using hierarchical models)
- applications of hierarchical planning
- plan explanation for hierarchical models
- hierarchical plan repair techniques
- techniques for verifying solutions of hierarchical planning problems
- techniques for automated learning and synthesis of hierarchical models
- using Generative AI (like, e.g., LLMs) for hierarchical planning or modeling



## Important Dates (updated!)

- Submission Deadline: <del>July 11 (Friday), 2025</del>
- Author Notification: <del>August 15 (Friday), 2025</del>
- Camera-Ready Deadline: September 26 (Friday), 2025
- ICAPS 2025 Workshops: November 10-11 (TBA), 2025


## Submission Details

The formatting guidelines ([author kit](https://icaps25.icaps-conference.org/files/icaps2025-author-kit.zip), etc.) are the same as for ICAPS 2025. There will be a high quality double-blind review process against the standard criteria of significance, soundness, scholarship, clarity, and reproducibility. However, submissions may be less evolved than at the main conference.

We have two categories:

1. Technical research papers (short or long) and
2. Challenge papers (short).

Technical research papers are like standard conference papers, but may be less evolved. The purpose of challenge papers is to report on or to make aware of interesting/important problems in Hierarchical Planning and to encourage discussion at the workshop -- not to present some significant contribution.

Authors may submit *long papers* (up to 8 pages plus up to one page of references) or *short papers* (up to 4 pages plus up to one page of references). The purpose of short papers is to encourage publications of more preliminary results; challenge papers need to be short papers. In case of acceptance, the full 9, resp. 5, pages can be used for the paper.

Submissions will be done via [easychair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=hplan2025). The system doesn't allow submissions yet, we are likely going to open it early June.

As written above, we are happy to check whether we can arrange an earlier submission, review, and notification date to accommodate your travel plans if required (e.g., for Visa). In this case we have to see how submissions will be done. Either way, contact the organizers at your earliest convenience in case you require this.

### Double Submissions

We encourage the submission of papers that, at the time of submission, are under review at another conference (including JELIA, ECAI, and KR, for example). However, if the paper is also accepted at the respective conference, it will *not* be included in our proceedings. The paper will be included into the program, but the proceedings will only contain a link to the respective conference's version.


## Accepted Papers

Once the final versions of all papers have been submitted, and once our invited speaker is confirmed, we will also make a proceedings available.

## Further Information

- **Are you interested in presenting your already published work?** Reach out to us!
- Do you want to join our team of reviewers? (Maybe even next year?) Please reach out to us!
- On the HPlan website [hplan.hierarchical-task.net](https://hplan.hierarchical-task.net) you find, among others, a list of bibtex entries for all accepted papers in all HPlan editions. Individual workshop pages of past editions are available by adding the respective year, e.g., you may use [hplan2024.hierarchical-task.net](https://hplan2024.hierarchical-task.net) for last year's edition (or [hplan2025.hierarchical-task.net](https://hplan2025.hierarchical-task.net) for this exact page).
- We have a mailing list (via google groups) for hierarchical planning with currently approx. 70 subscribers. The list is almost zero traffic (in some years it *is* literally zero), moderated, and only allows mails related to hierarchical planning! Interested? Drop Pascal an email.
