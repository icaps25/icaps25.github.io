# Workshop on Planning in the Era of LLMs (LM4Plan @ ICAPS 2025)

ICAPS 2025 Workshop, Melbourne, Australia, Date: 10-11 November, 2025

Visit https://llmforplanning.github.io/ for up-to-date information.


## Overview

Large Language Models (LLMs) are a disruptive force, changing how research was
done in many sub-areas of AI. Planning is one of the last bastions that remain
standing. The focus of this workshop is on the questions in the intersection of
these areas. Some of the specific areas we would like to gain a better
understanding in include: what LLMs can contribute to planning, how LLMs
can/should be used, what are the pitfalls of using LLMs, what are the guarantees
that can be obtained.

## Topics of Interest

We invite paper submissions on the following (not exhaustive) list of topics:

- Algorithms and theories of planning with pre-trained or fine-tuned LLMs.
- LLMs for (partial) model elicitation.
- LLMs for search guidance or search pruning.
- LLMs for planning modulo theories.
- LLMs as proxies for user preferences.
- Validation/verification of plans, policies, or models.
- Generalization in planning and generalized planning with LLMs.
- Using LLMs to develop interfaces for planning-related problems.
- Other applications of LLMs in planning.
- Other applications of large vision-language models (VLMs) in planning.
- Planning for LLMs and VLMs.


## Important Dates

- Paper submission deadline: **August 5th, 2025, AoE** (extended)
- Paper acceptance notification: **September 8th, 2025, AoE**

ICAPS will be in-person this year. Authors of accepted workshop papers are
expected to register for the workshop, physically attend the conference and
present in person.

## Submission Details

We solicit workshop paper submissions relevant to the above call of the following types:

- Long papers – up to 8 pages + unlimited references / appendices
- Short papers – up to 4 pages + unlimited references / appendices

Please format submissions in AAAI style (see instructions in the Author Kit of
the ICAPS 2025 Call for Papers). Authors submitting papers rejected from other
conferences, please ensure you do your utmost to address the comments given by
the reviewers. Please do not submit papers that are already accepted for the
main ICAPS conference to the workshop.

Paper submissions should be made through OpenReview.
