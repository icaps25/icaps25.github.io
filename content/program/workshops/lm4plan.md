# Workshop on Planning in the Era of LLMs (LM4Plan @ ICAPS 2025)

ICAPS 2025 Workshop, Melbourne, Australia, Date: 10-11 November, 2025

Visit https://llmforplanning.github.io/ for up-to-date information.


## Overview

Large Language Models (LLMs) are a disruptive force, changing how research was
done in many sub-areas of AI. Planning is one of the last bastions that remain
standing. The focus of this workshop is on the questions in the intersection of
these areas. Some of the specific areas we would like to gain a better
understanding in include: what LLMs can contribute to planning, how LLMs
can/should be used, what are the pitfalls of using LLMs, what are the guarantees
that can be obtained.

## Topics of Interest

We invite paper submissions on the following (not exhaustive) list of topics:

- Algorithms and theories of planning with pre-trained or fine-tuned LLMs.
- LLMs for (partial) model elicitation.
- LLMs for search guidance or search pruning.
- LLMs for planning modulo theories.
- LLMs as proxies for user preferences.
- Validation/verification of plans, policies, or models.
- Generalization in planning and generalized planning with LLMs.
- Using LLMs to develop interfaces for planning-related problems.
- Other applications of LLMs in planning.
- Other applications of large vision-language models (VLMs) in planning.
- Planning for LLMs and VLMs.


## Important Dates

- Paper submission deadline: **August 5th, 2025, AoE** (extended)
- Paper acceptance notification: **September 8th, 2025, AoE**

ICAPS will be in-person this year. Authors of accepted workshop papers are
expected to register for the workshop, physically attend the conference and
present in person.

## Submission Details

We solicit workshop paper submissions relevant to the above call of the following types:

- Long papers – up to 8 pages + unlimited references / appendices
- Short papers – up to 4 pages + unlimited references / appendices

Please format submissions in AAAI style (see instructions in the Author Kit of
the ICAPS 2025 Call for Papers). Authors submitting papers rejected from other
conferences, please ensure you do your utmost to address the comments given by
the reviewers. Please do not submit papers that are already accepted for the
main ICAPS conference to the workshop.

Paper submissions should be made through OpenReview.

## Invited Talk

**Towards Model-Based Reasoning in Large Language Models: A Planning Perspective**, by Nir Lipovetzky

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful at generating text, code,
and explanations, yet when it comes to structured reasoning, they often provide
incorrect responses. In this talk, we explore how ideas from automated planning
can help LLMs find structure in queries. We begin with Planning in the Dark,
where LLMs infer planning models from natural language, and their
non-determinism becomes a feature rather than a flaw with the restraints of
conformal prediction and symbolic planners. Next, through Planning-Driven
Programming, we show how planning-inspired techniques can guide LLMs to
iteratively refine code through reasoning and verification steps. Finally, we
turn to the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), demonstrating how planning
and knowledge augmentation can enhance compositional reasoning and
generalisation beyond training data. Research in AI planning outlines a path
toward LLMs that don’t just generate the next token, but also plan, reason, and
generalise with the assistance of model based planning solvers.

**Bio**: Nir Lipovetzky is an Associate Professor in the School of Computing and
Information Systems at the University of Melbourne. His research spans
artificial intelligence (AI) planning, heuristic search, learning, verification,
and intention recognition, with a particular focus on developing novel
approaches to inference in sequential decision-making problems. He contributes
to several AI planning initiatives, including the Lightweight Automated Planning
ToolKiT (LAPKT), designed to simplify the creation and extension of automated
planners; Planimation, a platform for visualising plans using declarative
programming; and planning.domains, a widely used suite of tools for teaching AI
planning. He is passionate about building bridges between AI planning and other
research areas.

#### Presentation instructions

All authors must present their papers. The **oral presentations are 20 minutes + 5
minutes for questions**. The **poster presentations get a 2-minute spotlight**
