# HAXP: Human-Aware and Explainable Planning

ICAPS'25 Workshop
Melbourne, Victoria, Australia
November 10 or 11, 2025

## Aim and Scope of the Workshop

As artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being adopted into application solutions, the challenge of supporting effective interactions with humans is becoming more apparent. Partly this is to support integrated working styles, in which humans and intelligent systems cooperate in problem-solving, but also it is a necessary step in the process of building and calibrating trust as humans migrate greater competence and responsibility to such systems. The International Workshop on Human-Aware and Explainable Planning (HAXP), formerly known as the Explainable AI Planning (XAIP) workshop, brings together the latest and best in human-AI interaction and explainability, in the context of planning, scheduling, RL and other forms of sequential decision-making process. The workshop is collocated with ICAPS, the premier conference on automated planning and scheduling. Learn more: [HAXP](https://haxp.org)

## Topics of Interest

The workshop includes - but is not limited to - the following topics:

* Human-aware planning, scheduling, and execution.
* Human monitoring, plan & goal recognition, and behavior prediction.
* Mixed-initiative planning and scheduling systems.
* Learning methods for planning/scheduling in the presence of humans.
* Explanations of behavior in sequential decision-making/decision-support.
* Explanation of scheduling/allocation decisions to human stakeholders.
* Improving interpretability and explainability of AI planning/scheduling systems.
* Generating predictable and interpretable behavior.
* Methods for reward, goal, preference, or constraint specification for reinforcement learning agents.
* Creating interpretable and adaptive user interfaces for planning/scheduling systems.
* Proactive assistance and decision-support in human-AI collaborative scenarios.
* Cognitive modeling, social interaction, and theory of mind.
* Safety, ethics, fairness, transparency and responsible behavior generation in the context of planning/scheduling systems.
* Representation and acquisition of human behavioral models.

## Submission Details

We invite submissions of the following types: 

* Full technical papers making an original contribution; up to 9 pages including references.
* Short technical papers making an original contribution; up to 5 pages including references. 
* Position papers proposing HAXP challenges, outlining HAXP ideas, debating issues relevant to HAXP; up to 5 pages including references.

Submissions will be hosted on [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=icaps-conference.org/ICAPS/2025/Workshop/HAXP)
Please ensure that you have registered with OpenReview. New profiles with an institutional email will be activated immediately. However, new profiles without an institutional email may take up to two weeks to be activated.

Papers must be prepared according to the instructions for ICAPS 2025 (in AAAI format) available at: [Paper template](https://icaps25.icaps-conference.org/files/icaps2025-author-kit.zip)


Authors who are considering submitting to the workshop papers rejected from the main conference, please ensure you do your utmost to address the comments given by ICAPS reviewers. Please do not submit papers that are already accepted for the main conference to the workshop.

Every submission will be reviewed by members of the program committee according to the usual criteria such as relevance to the workshop, the significance of the contribution, and technical quality. *Submissions are double-blind*.

The workshop is meant to be an open and inclusive forum, and we encourage papers that report on work in progress or that do not fit the mold of a typical conference paper.

At least one author of each accepted paper must attend the workshop in order to present the paper. All participants need to register to the main ICAPS conference. There will be no separate registration required.
