  abstract  = {Hierarchical goal networks (HGNs) provide a framework for goal-directed planning by decomposing high-level goals into ordered subgoals. While effective in deterministic settings, HGN planning has not been extended to handle stochastic domains. We introduce a new formalism for probabilistic HGN planning with task-insertion semantics, enabling probabilistic planners to incorporate domain knowledge from goal decomposition methods. This formalism retains the efficiency and scalability of classical HGN planning while supporting probabilistic reasoning and online search. We present PHGN-UCT, a UCT-based online planner that leverages hierarchical methods when available and falls back on UCT search when they are not, enabling planning under partial domain models. Preliminary experiments demonstrate that PHGN-UCT can effectively exploit even incomplete domain knowledge to outperform standard UCT planning, suggesting that probabilistic HGN methods are an effective way to incorporate domain knowledge in probabilistic planning.}

  abstract  = {We analyze Hierarchical World State Planning (HWSP), a novel algorithm that tackles the scalability limitations of Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning. By combining multi-level state abstraction with predictive task decomposition, HWSP reduces exponential search space growth. We formalize predictive separable tasks, classify planning domains, and derive tight bounds on search complexity. Our results show that HWSP transforms exponential interactions into linear coordination, enabling polynomial-time top-level planning in favorable domains where sibling tasks are independent. This enables efficient planning in complex domains that were previously intractable, opening up new possibilities for real-world applications.}

  abstract  = {The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating Automated Planning (AP) models has been widely explored; however, their application to Hierarchical Planning (HP) remains largely underexplored. In this work, we try to address this gap. We present two main contributions. First, we propose L2HP, an extension to the L2P library to support LLM-driven model generation for HP, with a focus on generality and extensibility. Second, we apply our framework to perform experiments where we compare the modeling capabilities of LLMs for AP and HP. On the PlanBench dataset, results show that parsing success is limited but comparable in both settings (around 36%), while syntactic validity is substantially lower in the hierarchical case (1\% vs. 20% of instances). These findings underscore the unique challenges HP presents for LLMs, highlighting the need for further research to improve the quality of generated HP models. }

  year      = {2025},
  abstract  = {To better capture real-world problems, Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning and numerical planning provide enhanced modeling capabilities over classical planning. However, the plan existence problem in these formalisms is generally undecidable. We identify restricted fragments that remain PSPACE-complete, matching the complexity of classical planning, while being more expressive. The most important result proves that plan existence in unordered HTN planning, i.e.\, ignoring all ordering relations, is PSPACE-complete. This shows that even minimal partial ordering causes a drastic increase in complexity. The result motivates a strong preference for unordered HTN models, a largely ignored fragment that deserves more attention. To bridge the gap between the tractable fragments of numerical and HTN planning, we introduce new formalisms that use Integer Linear Programs, Presburger formulas, and grammatical constraints to express action sequence restrictions within PSPACE, offering practical alternatives when the HTN structure is too complex to model.}

  year      = {2025},
  abstract  = {Hierarchical task network (HTN) planning extends classical planning by incorporating a hierarchy of tasks that gives plans additional structure and speeds up planning. However, it requires that each action be part of some task in the domain model, which makes it less flexible when the task hierarchy does not capture all the possibilities to achieve every task. HTN planning with task insertion (TIHTN) extends HTN planning by allowing the insertion of actions outside the hierarchy, thus giving more flexibility to constructing hierarchical plans. TIHTN has been proposed as a theoretical concept to show some decidability and complexity results. This paper describes an implemented TIHTN planner for totally ordered domains utilizing top-down grammar parsing.}
