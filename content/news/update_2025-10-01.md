Planning your trip to ICAPS25? Melbourne isn't just a world-class conference destination—it's a gateway to incredible experiences! 

**Melbourne City**: Dive into famous laneway cafes, vibrant street art, and cultural institutions like the National Gallery of Victoria. Our conference venue is in trendy Carlton, perfectly positioned to explore hip neighborhoods like Fitzroy, Collingwood, and Brunswick.

**Beyond the City**: Take a scenic drive along the Great Ocean Road to see the iconic Twelve Apostles, taste world-renowned wines in the Yarra Valley, or witness the magical Penguin Parade at Phillip Island.

We've curated an interactive travel guide with stunning photo galleries, local insider tips, and hidden gems that even locals love. From the best coffee spots (this IS Melbourne, after all!) to secret bars and must-see attractions.
